**Shopping card project**

This project features a shopping card designed to display product details organised. 
The desktop version is built using HTML and CSS, using **CSS Grid** for the primary layout and **Flexbox** for more refined control of element alignment and spacing.

**CSS Grid:** The card is organized into a grid with three columns, where the product image occupies a fixed-width column, and the remaining columns flexibly adjust for the product information and details. 

**Flexbox:** I use Flexbox in the _.product-price and .product-info sections_ to manage spacing and alignment. 
This approach provides a flexible and efficient way to arrange content, ensuring that elements are aligned and spaced consistently.
